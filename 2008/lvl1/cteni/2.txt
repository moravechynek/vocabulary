SNOOZE HABIT SNOOZE HABIT
My boyfriend falls asleep in front
of the television every night. I feel
annoyed by this because I think he
is doing it to avoid me, because he
never falls asleep when he’s got
friends round. If I complain, he
tells me to leave him alone –
saying he’s tired because he works
hard. It’s true – he does work very
hard, but he’s only 24. If he’s not
doing it to avoid me, do you think
there could be something medically
wrong with him? I’m starting to
get really fed up.
